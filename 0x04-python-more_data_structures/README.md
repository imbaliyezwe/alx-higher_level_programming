Dictionaries in Python are very similar to real-world dictionaries. These are mutable data structures that contain a collection of keys and, associated with them, values. This structure makes them very similar to word-definition dictionaries. For example, the word dictionary (our key) is associated with its definition (value) in Oxford online dictionary: a book or electronic resource that gives a list of the words of a language in alphabetical order and explains what they mean, or gives a word for them in a foreign language. Sets
Sets in Python can be defined as mutable dynamic collections of immutable unique elements. The elements contained in a set must be immutable. Sets may seem very similar to lists, but in reality, they are very different.

First, they may only contain unique elements, so no duplicates are allowed. Thus, sets can be used to remove duplicates from a list. Next, like sets in mathematics, they have unique operations which can be applied to them, such as set union, intersection, etc. Finally, they are very efficient in checking whether a specific element is contained in a set.
